  <h2>Factoring Trinomial using AC Method</h2>
  <h4>Solve:6
  step 1:        Factor out anything common to all terms.
  step 2:        Write trinomial in sandard form ax2+bx+c
  step 3:        Determine product of a･ｃ=3･28=84
  step 4:List all pairs of factors of a･ｃIfa･ｃ is negative,then factors have opposite signs.Ifa･ｃ is positive,then factors have
    same signs, Sign od b determines sign of factors.
    Factorof  are:
    Select factor pair such that their sum is b term=20
    
  step 5:        Sprit middle term b order factors as multiple of the a and c terms
    
    step 6: Factor out something common to first two terms.
    
    steo 7: Factor out same binominal in last two terms.
    
    step 8: Apply Distributive Law and convert trinomial into the product of two binomials and a monomial.
    2x[(3x-14)(x-2)]
