  <h2>Factoring Trinomial using AC Method</h2>
  <h4>Solve:6
  step 1:2x[]       Factor out anything common to all terms.<br>
  step 2:   []     Write trinomial in sandard form ax2+bx+c<br>
  step 3:   []     Determine product of a･ｃ=3･28=84<br>
  step 4:List all pairs of factors of a･ｃIfa･ｃ is negative,then factors have opposite signs.Ifa･ｃ is positive,then factors have
    same signs, Sign od b determines sign of factors.
    Factorof  are:
    Select factor pair such that their sum is b term=20<br>
    
  step 5:  []      Sprit middle term b order factors as multiple of the a and c terms<br>
    
    step 6:[]　[] Factor out something common to first two terms.<br>
    
    steo 7: []Factor out same binominal in last two terms.<br>
    
    step 8: Apply Distributive Law and convert trinomial into the product of two binomials and a monomial.
